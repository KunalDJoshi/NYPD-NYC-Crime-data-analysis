# NYPD-NYC-Crime-data-analysis
Analyzed the NYPD arrest dataset with the help of the Weka tool. Perform data exploration, data preprocessing, creation of training dataset and testing dataset, models creation and models evaluation. Used classification algorithms such as Na√Øve Bayes classifier, J48, Bagging and K-Nearest Neighbour. J48 and Bagging classifiers gave highets accuracies of around 54%. Used Apriori algorithm for association rule mining to find best 20 rules. Performed models evaluation by using various measures such as Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix, ROC. Developed python program to split large CSV files into  smaller CSV files. Created reports using tableau for better data visualization.
